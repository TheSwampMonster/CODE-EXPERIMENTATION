    </h1>
        
        <p>
        Ideally, once i am done with this page i will have tested and tried every html, java, and css command and element. <br /> Shit is real crazy.<br />we have to make a list of something to try out the unordered list and ordered list commands. <br /> We are going to go top to bottom with html and then go from there. 
        </p>

        <pre> here is something interesting, i can preserve{formatting} ( strText ){alert (strText</pre>
        <p> There is a thing called "Non breaking space" that prevents phrases like movie titles from being broken up by word wrap. EG: "Herrr&nbsp;Purrer&nbsp;und&nbsp;Da&nbsp;Prisuner&nbsp;Ofakbarban."</p>
        
        <p align="left">This one should be sitting on the left<br />side of the page</p>
        <p align="center">this one is center</p>
        <p align="right">awwwwww shit we got <br />left side of the <br />page over here.<br /> Alignin shit all over the place in this motherfucker</p>
        
        <!-- below we talk about Core Attributes that one can add to an element to uniquely identify it:
            Id
            Title
            Class
            Style
        -->
         <p id="booty">This bit of the page is dedicated to my girl's booty. This boooty oh my god where do i even begin.<br /> This booty so fine that you just wanna crawl up in it and take a nap and never wake up.<br /> This booty will likely be a contributing factor to the outbreak of the next world war.<br /> I dream about this booty every single night. THis is the kind of booty that booty connoisseurs talk about with their colleagues and spouses and children and grandparents. This booty was at least partly responsible for the design and building of the Eiffel Tower. <br />There is a legend that this booty cant be killed. Once its owner dies it just flies away and blesses some other lucky mortal with it's powers and charms. 24 karat magic booty. It is so fine that i can't ever hope to to even put into words how fine this booty is. <br />So really, i guess we are done here aren't we? </p>
         
        <p title="Ay you nasty little feck. The fueck you doing in here what the fuock did i tell can you not fockin read? I mean honestly what are you doing in here. Was your mother some sort of barn animal never taught you not to hover on shit you aren't supposed to hover on? Jesus H just get out of here will you what are you doing here can't you see i'm naked anyway damn.">Don't you dare hover on this shit.</p>
        
        <h4 class="Nipple" >This is the nipple spot. It is okay to hover here but don't make it the entire show. Just come back here intermittently and it'll accent everything really well. The nipple spot is not the main event but it can be the popcorn for everyone involved.</h4>
        
        <p style="font-family:arial; color:lawngreen; font-size: 11px;"> I used the style element here to write CSS directly into my html. WHile i have your attention here is the swamp monster's teeny list on top 5 green things:<br /> -Frongs- <br /> -Money- <br /> -Plants- <br /> -My girl's eyes when she has the right shirt on- <br /> -The Swamp Monster (obv)- </p>
        
        <p dir="rtl">Some languages like arabic read right to left instead of left to right. <br />So i told the browser to print this starting on the right side of the page. </p>
        
        <p>So back when we were higher up on the page and i was making shit <strong>Bold</strong> and <u>Underlined</u> and <i>Italicized</i> I did not know that i could also make things <strike>Strikethrough</strike> or <sup>SuperDuperscripted</sup> or even <sub> subscripted </sub>. I can also <tt> Monospace shit, this probably has a use in the real world but i am not familiar with what that use is. </tt> If i like or need. I can make words <big>Big</big> and <small>Small.</small> Pretty exciting shit right? Next up we work with div and span elements.</p>
        
        <div id="buttholes"> This is a div element. I have IDd it "buttholes."<br /> This is because i am not actually 23, I am 12 and i got stuck in a 23 year old's body. My life is like a shitty version of the movie "BIG" starring Tom Hanks. <br />Buttholes Buttholes Buttholes <br /> Buttholes.</div>
        
        <p>Buttholes. <span style="color: darkblue">Buttholes. </span><span style="color: red">Buttholes. </span> <span style="color:orchid">Buttholes. </span><span style="color:orange">Buttholes. </span><span style="color:yellow">Buttholes. </span></p>
        
        <h3>God bless the span tag I mean really look at all those beautiful <span style="color: deeppink">COLORFUL</span> <big>Buttholes!</big></h3>
